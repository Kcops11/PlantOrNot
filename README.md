# PlantOrNot
A beginner-level machine vision project that identifies whether something is a plant or not.


Hello, thank you for taking the time to check this repository out. 

This is my first project in the machine vision domain. In this very basic project, I intend to train a model to recognize whether an object present in the screen is a plant or not. This will help me build a foundation for later projects where I would also like to focus on plants and have a model identify them.
